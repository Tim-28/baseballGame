# baseballGame
A choose-your-own-adventure style baseball game built with Python.
If you called my home on a summer morning when I was growing up, and I didn't answer, most likely I was across the street playing baseball with my buddies. Ever since the third grade, I have been a faithful Saint Louis Cardinals fan - through thick and thin.
This short game was written in Python and features conditionals, functions, and the random choice method in addition to other code. 
Please play it on your local machine, and whatever you do, don't give up a big hit!! After all, your team is counting on you! :o)
